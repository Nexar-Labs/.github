‚öõÔ∏è Nexar Labs: Where Physics Meets AI

Welcome to Nexar Labs! We are at the frontier of physics simulations powered by Deep Learning and Generative AI. Our goal is to push the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible by blending computational physics with state-of-the-art AI technologies. Together, we aim to solve complex real-world problems across domains such as climate modeling, materials science, and intelligent systems.

üåê What We Do

At Nexar Labs, we explore the intersection of AI and physics-based simulations, leveraging advanced computational techniques and machine learning to create smarter, more efficient simulations.

	‚Ä¢	Physics Simulations: From Material Point Method (MPM) and Finite Element Method (FEM) to advanced multi-physics models, we build high-fidelity simulations for real-world phenomena.
	‚Ä¢	AI and GenAI: Using Neural Networks, Generative Models (GANs, VAEs, Diffusion), and Reinforcement Learning, we automate, augment, and enhance simulations in ways never before possible.
	‚Ä¢	Fusion of Simulation and AI: By combining Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) with physics models, we aim to reduce the computational cost of simulations while maintaining accuracy, enabling real-time and large-scale applications.

üî• Featured Projects
